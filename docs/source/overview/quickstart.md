# Quickstart

The fastest way to see QC-Studio end to end is the fMRIPrep demo.
It runs on a small BIDS dataset with fMRIPrep derivatives, included in the repository under `sample_data/`.

## 1. Install

Follow [Installation](installation.md) if you have not already.

## 2. Run the demo

From the repository root:

```bash
./fmriprep_demo.sh
```

Streamlit starts on port 8501 and prints the launch configuration:

```text
Launching QC-Studio with:
  qc_json=./pipelines/fmriprep/qc_demo.json
  qc_json_for_ui=../pipelines/fmriprep/qc_demo.json
  qc_task=anat_wf_qc
  dataset_dir=sample_data
  participant_list=sample_data/qc_participants_demo.tsv
  session_list=ses-01
  port=8501
```

Open <http://localhost:8501> in your browser.

## 3. Take your first ratings

### Landing page

1. **👤 Rater Information** — enter your rater name or ID, and adjust the other rater details and autoplay settings as needed.
2. **🖼️ Display Panels** — choose which panels to show, and set the montage grid's maximum rows and columns. At least one panel is required.
3. **📤 Upload Existing QC File** — optional. Pick a previous results or checkpoint file to resume where you left off.

The sidebar lets you choose the QC task to rate and the [default rating](../guides/ratings.md#default-rating)
preselected on unrated pages.

Click **Continue to QC 🚀**.

### QC pages

There is one QC page per QC record.

- The left sidebar has **▶️ Play** and **⏸️ Pause** for [Autoplay](../guides/autoplay.md),
  **◀️ Previous** and **Next ▶️** buttons, and a page counter.
- The main area shows the selected panels for the task, followed by **📊 Rate**, with the rating
  choices and a notes box.

Click a rating and add notes if needed. Your rating and notes are recorded as soon as you change them,
so **Next** simply moves on to the next page. If the page shows several QC tasks, rate every task
before clicking **Next**.

Ratings are kept in the app's memory until you save them to a file. Click **🏁 Create checkpoint**
at any time to write a timestamped snapshot to the output directory.

### Summary page

Once every QC page is rated, **Next** opens a summary of your ratings.
Click **💾 Export Final Results** to write one results TSV per QC task.

## Running QC-Studio on your own data

The demo script is a wrapper around a `streamlit run` command. To review your own data, run that
command directly with your own paths:

```bash
streamlit run ui/main.py --server.port=8501 -- \
    --dataset_dir /path/to/dataset \
    --participant_list /path/to/participants.tsv \
    --session_list ses-01 \
    --qc_json /path/to/qc.json \
    --qc_task <task-name> \
    --qc_pipeline <pipeline-name> \
    --output_dir /path/to/output
```

A few things to note:

- The `--` separates Streamlit's own options (such as `--server.port`) from QC-Studio's flags.
- Use `--session_list none` if your dataset has no sessions.
- A relative `--qc_json` path is resolved against the `ui/` directory, so absolute paths are safest.

See [Configuration](../guides/configuration.md) for what each flag does, or run `python ui/main.py --help`.
