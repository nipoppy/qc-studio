# QC-Studio documentation

QC-Studio is a web-based quality control (QC) application for neuroimaging data. It gives raters
a unified, portable interface, accessible from any web browser, to review raw imaging data, processed
pipeline derivatives, and image quality metrics (IQMs), and export ratings as a tab-separated table.

Key benefits:

- **Local and Remote QC** — QC-Studio can run locally or on a remote server that holds the data. Raters with access can review it in a local browser, without having to copy data.
- **Broad format support** — QC-Studio is built on [NiiVue](https://github.com/niivue/niivue), which displays volumetric and surface data in most common neuroimaging formats.
- **Custom QC protocols** — choose which images to show and which rating scales to use for each QC task.
